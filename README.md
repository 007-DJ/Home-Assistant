Brian,
here I my current files. This dir in Github is the \config directory of HA (Home Assistant)
Configuration [Check Configuration] = Configuration valid!
automation in /config/automation.yaml shows in UI and works.
automation in /config/include/other.yaml is not displayed in UI and does not work.
automation in /config/automations/standalone.yaml is not displayed in UI and does not work.
if you figure it out.... Phone here is (603) 706-0415.  Thanks
